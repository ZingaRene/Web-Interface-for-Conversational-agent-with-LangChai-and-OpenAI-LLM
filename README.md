# Web-Interface-for-Conversational-agent-with-LangChai-and-OpenAI-LLM

#### In this project, we built a web interface to serve an LLM. We took the opportunity to incorporate search functionality into our application. To make everything even more professional, the deployment was done through a Docker container. We used OpenAI's LLM, and to reproduce the project, you need its API key.
